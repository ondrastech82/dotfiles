## Sources
This is all sources that inspired me for my rice
### Copycats (Base)
The base of this rie is [Luca CPZ's awesome repo](https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats).
My base theme is **Copland**.
### Color scheme
I use [Nord color scheme](https://www.nordtheme.com/ports
"official Nord page of suported apps") for termite, vim and vscode.  
**For vim** the repo must be downloaded as zip and than the nord.vim moved to `usr/share/vim/vim82/colors`

Stolen from subreddit [r/MinimalWallpaper](https://www.reddit.com/r/MinimalWallpaper/comments/db0wgm/open_sourcerer_3840x2160/

`sudo pacman -S compton`
